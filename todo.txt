- test cases for different temperatures

- plot different betas different cases eta comparison

- change train dimension in T_POD_training to 25 or more

- align ModifiedNewton properly

- check Newton if plot already first iteration and not initial

- use mesh_coarse to check plots and working code!

- effect of theta on adjoint and state

<<<<<<< HEAD
- Reduction with varying beta, 10^-7 paper, current sim 10^-10

- Install ffmpeg on windows work station
=======
- the smaller beta the more difficult the reduction
