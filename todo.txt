- test cases for different temperatures (videos)

- plot different betas different cases eta comparison

- change train dimension in T_POD_training to 25 or more

- align ModifiedNewton properly

- check Newton if plot already first iteration and not initial

- use mesh_coarse to check plots and working code!

- effect of theta on adjoint and state

- Reduction with varying beta, 10^-7 paper, current sim 10^-10

- Install ffmpeg on windows work station

- the smaller beta the more difficult the reduction

- UPDATE README
