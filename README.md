- mesh_meshname.mat files contains mesh information in matlab format for the three test cases

MATLAB PACKAGES NEEDED

- code is tested on MATLAB R2020b with the following toolboxes:  (TO ADD)
  


RUNNING THE CODE

0. (once and for all) navigate redbkit folder and run make.m to compiler mex files (need matlab mex compiler)

1. go back to main folder and run the following scripts:

- assemble_problem.m   generate Full-Order-Model (FOM) matrices using mesh data

- SS_reduction.m       generate POD training snapshots and test ROM for steady-state problem, need data structure generated by assemble_problem.m

- T_POD_training.m     generate POD training snapshots for transient problem (quite time consuming)

- T_reduction.m        from training data generated by T_POD_training.m build reduced order model and test performances

- T_plots.m            Using output of T_reduction.m generate figures and videos
